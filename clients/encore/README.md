# Encore QA Automation

End-to-end Playwright test suite for Navigator Cloud (`cloudapps-e2e.encoreglobal.com`). Produces two reports per run (Playwright HTML + Allure).
Browser projects (`chromium`, `encore-local-office`, `encore-locations`) and parallelism (worker count — parallel test threads) are configurable per run.
Defaults are in `playwright.config.ts`, overridable via CLI flags or environment variables.

---

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 18
- npm ≥ 9
- ~1 GB disk for browsers + dependencies
- Network access to `cloudapps-e2e.encoreglobal.com` and Microsoft login endpoints

---

## Quickstart

Clone this repository and change into its root folder. Every command in this Quickstart runs from that one folder.

**1. Install dependencies and browsers.**

```bash
npm run setup
```

**2. Open `.env.local` and fill in your credentials.**

Open `.env.local` and fill in the two blank values at the top — your Navigator username and password.
Ask the QA automation team for a test account if you do not have one. Nothing else in that file needs changing.

`.env.e2e` is already in the folder — do not create or edit it. It is only read on a build server.

**3. Confirm login and setup are working.**

```bash
npm run test:grep -- "TC-LOC-CUR-001" --project=encore-locations
```

Green means login and setup are fine. It takes about one minute.

**4. Run the full suite and view results.**

```bash
npm run test:cli
```

Then open results with `npm run report` (Playwright HTML) or `npm run allure:report` (Allure).

## Running the suite

| Command | What it does | Why run it this way | Audience |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npm run test:cli` | Full suite, Allure history preserved across runs | Stashes and restores Allure history so trend data grows run over run. Use instead of bare `npm test`. | both |
| `npm test` | Full suite, no history-preservation chain | Only when trend tracking is not needed | both |
| `npm run share-for-debugging` | Packages traces (step-by-step test recordings), screenshots, videos, and logs into a zip for sharing | Run after every run. A flaky (sometimes passes on retry) test's failing trace only lives in this bundle. | both |
| `MAX_WORKERS=1 npm run test:cli` | Force the worker count to 1 | Keep workers at 1. Multiple workers edit the same office simultaneously — one test's save disrupts another's assertion. | both |
| [Failure categorization](#failure-categorization) | Read the failure category before filing anything | Auth/network: retry. Timing/selector: QA team. Application/data: product team. | both |
| `npm run test:failed` | Re-run only tests that failed in the last run | Faster feedback loop when fixing a small set of failures | local |
| `npm run clean:run <spec>` | Wipe all reports, run one spec (a single test file), rebuild from scratch | Use when you need a report containing exactly one test and nothing stale | local |
| `npm run test:grep -- "pattern"` | Run tests whose title or tag matches the pattern | Find and run a specific test without running everything | local |
| `npm run test:ui` | Open the Playwright interactive UI | Step through tests visually; useful when building or debugging a single case | local |
| `npm run test:debug` | Run with the Playwright debugger attached | Step through a single test line by line | local |
| `npm run test:headed` | Run in a visible browser window | Watch what the test does in real time | local |
| `npx playwright test --list` | List every discoverable test without running | Check which tests exist before running them | local |
| `npx playwright test --project=chromium` | Run the full suite via the chromium project | Direct Playwright invocation for one-off runs | both |
| `npx playwright test <path> --project=chromium` | Run a single spec or directory | Direct Playwright invocation for a targeted run | both |
| Evidence bundle (CI) | Archive `reports/share-for-debugging-*.zip` on every run | Archive every run. The build server retries twice. A pass-on-retry only has a trace in the bundle. | CI |
| `npm run setup` | Install Node dependencies and all Playwright browsers | Run once after unzipping, or after a Node version upgrade | local |
| `npm run setup:browsers` | Install chromium, firefox, and webkit | Re-install browsers only, without touching Node packages | local |
| `npm run clean` | Delete all report and result folders | Start with a completely empty reports directory before a fresh run | both |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check all TypeScript without running tests | Catch type errors without running the full suite | both |

### Clean single-spec run — report holds only that one run

When you want a report containing **exactly one spec, one run, zero stale data** (e.g. to screenshot a single module's result):

```bash
npm run clean:run -- tests/locations/location-auto-addon.spec.ts
npm run report          # Playwright HTML
npm run allure:report   # Allure
```

`clean:run` wipes both report systems (including the Allure history cache), runs only the spec you name, and regenerates Allure from scratch.
Unlike `test:cli` — which runs the **whole suite** and **preserves** trend history — this is single-spec and history-free.
Accepts any spec path or a `--grep "..."` filter.

### Tuning parallelism

Worker count defaults to 1 everywhere in `playwright.config.ts` due to an unresolved multi-worker conflict on shared Encore app state.
When two workers run tests against the same office (e.g., 1604) in parallel, one worker's save surprises the other's mid-test assertion, causing false failures.
Override per run with the `MAX_WORKERS` env var only if you understand this limitation:

```bash
MAX_WORKERS=4 npm test          # 4 workers (use only if aware of shared-state conflict)
MAX_WORKERS=1 npm test          # force serial (the default, safest)
```

More workers = faster wall-clock but higher contention on shared app state.
Module projects keep `fullyParallel: false` so each spec file stays in one worker (required for the per-test baseline-reset ordering).
Different spec files still run in parallel across workers.

## Reports

After every run:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `reports/html-report/` | Latest Playwright HTML report |
| `reports/allure-report/` | Latest Allure report (with Environment, Categories, Trend) |
| `reports/failure-summary.json` | Machine-readable failure data (see **Failure categorization** below) |
| `reports/junit-results.xml` | JUnit XML for CI dashboards |
| `reports/test-results.json` | Raw Playwright results |

Each test step in the Playwright HTML report reads as a plain-English action (e.g. "Open the Currency tab", "Save changes and confirm") instead of raw selector code.
The report is readable without a technical background. Expand any step to see the underlying detail.

### Viewing reports locally

```bash
npm run report            # opens the Playwright HTML report
npm run allure:report     # generates + opens Allure in the browser
```

### When a test fails

Run `npm run share-for-debugging` after every local run. The sample workflow below already includes it as a step.
The script writes `reports/share-for-debugging-<timestamp>.zip` containing the diagnostic JSON, traces, screenshots, videos, and logs.
Send that one file to the QA automation team — that's all they need.
The bundle also records tests that failed first and passed on retry.
Those are marked `"finalOutcome": "flaky"` in `failure-summary.json` and still carry their failing attempt's trace and screenshot.

## Running it on GitHub Actions

1. **Put this project in a GitHub repository.** The folder you cloned is the repository root — the workflow file's paths assume that layout.

2. **Add the two credentials as repository secrets.**
   Go to **Settings**, then **Secrets and variables**, then **Actions**, then **New repository secret**.
   Add two secrets named exactly `NAVIGATOR_USERNAME` and `NAVIGATOR_PASSWORD`.
   Secrets cannot be read back afterwards, by anyone.

3. **Create the workflow file.**
   Create `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` in the repository root and paste this content:

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - run: npm ci

      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:cli
        env:
          CI_ENV: e2e
          NAVIGATOR_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.NAVIGATOR_USERNAME }}
          NAVIGATOR_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.NAVIGATOR_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Package debugging evidence
        run: npm run share-for-debugging
        if: always()

      - name: Upload evidence bundle
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: e2e-evidence
          path: reports/share-for-debugging-*.zip
```

This workflow triggers on pushes to `main` only — trigger it manually from the Actions tab if you are on a different branch.

4. **Push, then open the Actions tab and watch the run.**

5. **When it goes red**, download the evidence bundle from the run's Artifacts and send that one file to the QA automation team.

Run `npm run share-for-debugging` and archive the resulting `reports/share-for-debugging-<timestamp>.zip` after EVERY run — pass, fail, or flaky.
A test that fails and then passes on retry only leaves its failing-attempt trace inside that bundle; if the bundle is only archived on failure, that evidence is lost.

On a build server, `.env.e2e` values win over anything in `.env.local`. Locally, `.env.e2e` is not read at all — `.env.local` supplies everything.

This delivery contains no `.github` folder on purpose — create that file yourself using the workflow above.

## Failure categorization

Every failing run writes `reports/failure-summary.json`. Each failure carries a `failureCategory` classified into one of:

| Category | Who to file with |
|---|---|
| `AUTH` | Transient SSO flake — retry. Escalate if persistent. |
| `NETWORK` | Usually upstream / environment. Re-run before triaging. |
| `TIMING` / `SELECTOR` / `INFRASTRUCTURE` | Framework-side — file with the QA automation team |
| `APPLICATION` / `DATA` (a.k.a. "Product Defects") | App-side — file with Encore's product team |

Allure's **Categories** panel groups failures into the same buckets visually.

---

## Updating

Receive the latest version from the QA automation team.
Do **not** commit or edit files under `src/**` or `tests/**` — those are framework-owned and will be overwritten on the next update.
If you need a change in those paths, request it from the QA automation team.

Safe-to-edit without conflicts: anything under `reports/` (generated output) and `node_modules/` (installed). Credentials live in your environment / secret store, not in the repo.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Nothing runs at all** — `npm install` exited non-zero, or `npx playwright install chromium` didn't complete. Re-run both; check node/npm versions meet the requirements above.
2. **Every test fails with auth errors** — credentials expired or rotated. Update the credentials in your environment / secret store (`NAVIGATOR_USERNAME` / `NAVIGATOR_PASSWORD`).
3. **`TC-LOC-CUR-001` verify fails but the app works in a browser** — Microsoft SSO is having a bad moment. Retry in 5 minutes before deeper triage.
4. **Reports look empty / blank widgets** — run `npm run clean` and re-run `test:cli`. Some widgets (Trend) only populate after the second run.
5. **Allure Trend never grows** — ensure `test:cli` is used. `npm test` alone runs the suite without the stash/restore chain, so history doesn't accumulate.
6. **`Missing required env var: BASE_URL`** — `.env.local` is missing or its values at the top are still blank. Go back to Quickstart step 2.
7. **`Credentials unavailable: Invalid credentials: username and password required`** —
   the two values in `.env.local` are still empty, or the account requires an authenticator code and the tests cannot type one.

---

## License & credentials

Locally, credentials go in `.env.local`.
On a build server, they come from that server's secret store.
`.env.e2e` holds no passwords in either case.
Do not commit `.env.local` once you have filled it in.
