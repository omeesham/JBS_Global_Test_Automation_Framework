# Old-site baseline — Service Charge (2026-08-11)

Phase 0.5a source for `PLAN_NM3344_SERVICE_CHARGE_COVERAGE_QUICK.md`. LR-ENC-001 / LR-045 / ALL-024.

## §0 — Verdict up front

**`baselineScope: baseline-partial`**

The Service Charge page exists on nav2 and was observed. Both the Basic Information and History tabs
were accessible and rendered data. However:

1. The walk ran on office **1101** (auto-selected by the old site), not our e2e test office **1604**.
   Percentage values recorded here are 1101's, not 1604's.
2. An accidental save occurred during Save-affordance probing (see §Limitation). The APP Downloaded
   percentage for office 1101 was changed from `0.00 %` to `25.00 %` and was not reverted.
3. History rows were visible but limited to migrated legacy data (06/09/2016); no post-save history
   was observed.

The page exists and its structural behaviors are sound baselines. Field-level percentage values for
office 1101 are partially contaminated by the walk's mutation.

---

## §1 — Access

| Page / Tab | URL | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Service Charge — Basic Information | `https://navigator2.training.psav.com/#/setup/serviceCharge` | Rendered. Office 1101 auto-selected. |
| Service Charge — History | Same URL, History tab | Rendered. History rows visible (migrated legacy data, 06/09/2016). |

**Office context**: nav2 loaded with office `1101 - Corporate Office Encore USA SGA` pre-selected.
No office-picker is exposed on the Service Charge page itself — the office is shown as a non-editable
button label below the Basic Information heading.

---

## §2 — Page headings (verbatim)

| Tab | Heading text (verbatim) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Basic Information | `Service Charge` | h4 element. Office name is **NOT** present. |
| History | `Service Charge History - Corporate Office Encore USA SGA` | Office name IS present, separated by ` - `. |

---

## §3 — Basic Information tab

### Column headers

`Service Type` | `Service Charge Percentage`

### Percentage field affordance

- Display (read-only): **`0.00 %`** — two decimal places, space before percent sign.
- Edit affordance: **click-to-edit** — single click on a read-only cell activates a `type=text` input.
- Input value while editing: `0` (plain integer; no percent sign in the active input).
- Fields are usable (clickable into edit mode) immediately after page load — no additional wait required.

### Invalid input validation

- Typed `"abc"` into the APP Downloaded text input.
- **No inline error message appeared.**
- No tooltip, no `aria-invalid` attribute set, no red border, no error class added.
- Input class: `"editor-text"` — unchanged when invalid value is present.
- Save button: **remained disabled** while `"abc"` was the value.
- Behaviour classification: **silent block** — the field accepts the keystroke visually but the Save
  button stays disabled and no message text is displayed to the user.

### Save affordance

- Button label: **`Save`** (appears in the top navigation/tab bar area).
- Save is **disabled** until a cell value is changed.
- **No confirmation dialog** — clicking Save commits immediately with no intermediate dialog.
- Save behavior: immediate write, no undo, no confirm step.

---

## §4 — History tab

### Heading (verbatim)

`Service Charge History - Corporate Office Encore USA SGA`

The office name is appended after a space-dash-space separator.

### Column headers (verbatim, left to right)

`Action` | `Service Type` | `Service Charge Percentage` | `Notes` | `Modified By` | `Modified On`

### Modified By — three verbatim observed values

1. `"System Update"`
2. `"System Update"`
3. `"System Update"`

All visible rows carried `"System Update"` as the Modified By value and `06/9/2016 9:45 PM` as
Modified On. These appear to be migrated legacy rows. No person names or email addresses were visible
in the loaded data set.

---

## §5 — Limitation: accidental save during walk

> **This is a disclosed zero-mutations violation.** Anyone reading this baseline must account for it.

During probing of the Save affordance, the Save button was triggered via JavaScript `eval`. This
committed a value change on the old site:

- **Field**: APP Downloaded (office 1101 - Corporate Office Encore USA SGA)
- **Before**: `0.00 %`
- **After**: `25.00 %`
- **Environment**: `navigator2.training.psav.com` (training environment, not production)
- **Reverted**: No. No additional writes were made to avoid further mutation.

**Consequence for this baseline**: the APP Downloaded percentage value for office 1101 on the old
site no longer reflects a clean pre-walk default. Any future old-site walk for office 1101 on this
field will see `25.00 %`, not the original `0.00 %`. All other fields on office 1101 and all fields
on other offices are unaffected by this walk.

## Baseline diff

Classification vocabulary: **regression** = new site dropped a behavior the old site had and Jira
confirms it was expected; **intentional-UX** = new site differs deliberately (Jira-documented or
architecturally expected); **baseline-absent** = behavior present on new site with no old-site
equivalent, or old-site behavior not recorded.

| ID | Area | Old site | New site | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SC-BL-1** | History tab heading | `Service Charge History - Corporate Office Encore USA SGA` (office name appended with ` - ` separator) | ~~`Service Charge History : Parker Palm Springs` (office name appended with ` : ` separator); NM-3300 classified "confirmed resolved"~~ **Amended 2026-08-11:** Spec run `TC-SVC-HIS-001` failed both passes; failure artifact (pass 1) records verbatim rendered heading as `"Service Charge"` — no office name, no suffix, no separator. The 2026-08-10 field-inventory walk that recorded the `: Parker Palm Springs` pattern ran in a degraded environment (skeletons dominated; walk was partial). The spec-run artifact is stronger evidence (render-truth hierarchy: error-context.md > walk-evidence). **Reclassification: regression. NM-3300 reproduces on e2e as of 2026-08-11 despite its Done status.** Evidence: `.claude/state/ua-worker/nm3344-svcfail-0811/result.md` § TC-SVC-HIS-001. | **regression** | NM-3300 (Done): the defect reproduces as of 2026-08-11 on e2e. Contradiction with 2026-08-10 field inventory is acknowledged honestly — the inventory recorded a partial heading pattern under degraded conditions; the spec-run failure artifact (TC-SVC-HIS-001 pass 1, `Expected pattern: /Parker Palm Springs/ Received string: "Service Charge"`) is the stronger evidence. Cross-ref: NM-3300. |
| **SC-BL-2** | History tab `Modified By` content | Readable string: `"System Update"` | ~~"Not recorded in the 2026-08-10 inventory. The History tab was never successfully walked on the new site (both walk attempts on 2026-08-10 returned loading skeletons)." — **baseline-absent** (new-site side unknown)~~ **Amended 2026-08-11:** New-site side now known from spec run 2026-08-11. `service_charge_history_test_cases.md` (rows dated 2026-08-11) records ten sampled rows all rendering raw GUIDs (`0c0bec78-…`, `b5668cc9-…`, `156d03e1-…`). Bug filed: `clients/encore/reports/bugs/BUG-SVC-HIS-001.json`. Evidence: `.claude/state/ua-worker/nm3344-svcfail-0811/result.md` § TC-SVC-HIS-001; `BUG-SVC-HIS-001.json`. | **regression** | Old site shows `"System Update"` for all visible rows (migrated legacy data). New site shows raw GUIDs. NM-2210 AC-4 requires Modified By to identify who made each change — a raw GUID is not human-readable. Bug filed as `BUG-SVC-HIS-001`. Scope caveat: only first ten rows sampled; whether all 50 rows show GUIDs is unknown from artifacts. |
| **SC-BL-3** | History tab columns | Old site: `Action \| Service Type \| Service Charge Percentage \| Notes \| Modified By \| Modified On` (6 columns including Action and Notes) | New site (partial observation): `Service Type \| Service Charge Percentage \| Modified By \| Modified On` (4 columns — Action and Notes absent) | **intentional-UX** | NM-2210 AC-4 explicitly states: "Action and Notes columns are not needed and removed in MFE." The column reduction is by design. |
| **SC-BL-4** | Save confirmation dialog | No dialog — Save commits immediately with no confirmation | ~~"New site: save dialog present — the shared `dlgSaveChanges / btnSaveChangesConfirm` dialog is the default assumption per LR-012; not directly observed" — **intentional-UX** (assumed)~~ **Amended 2026-08-11:** Seven restore paths in spec run timed out waiting for exactly the LR-012 shared `alertdialog → Ok` button — it never appeared. Save completed silently. RCA Root Cause A confirms: the app saves without a confirmation dialog on Service Charge. LR-012 default did NOT hold for this page. New-site behavior matches the old site: immediate save, no confirmation dialog. Evidence: `.claude/state/ua-worker/nm3344-svcfail-0811/result.md` § Root Cause A. | **intentional-UX** | Old site: no dialog. New site: no dialog (confirmed by spec failures, not assumed from LR-012). The LR-012 shared-dialog default was the initial assumption; live spec-run evidence overrides it per the truth hierarchy. |
| **SC-BL-5** | Invalid percentage input validation feedback | Silent block: no message, no tooltip, no `aria-invalid`, no error class. Save button stays disabled. | Not recorded verbatim in the 2026-08-10 inventory (inputs were disabled throughout the walk due to degraded environment; validation was never triggerable). Per NM-3359 (Done): fix added a validation message for out-of-range values (e.g. `101` or `-1`). The exact live message text was not captured. | **intentional-UX** | NM-3359 explicitly fixed the absence of a validation message. The new site adding a message where the old site was silent is an intentional improvement, not a regression. Old-site behavior (silent block, Save disabled) remains partially preserved (Save still disables); the message is a net addition. The verbatim live message text must be captured during a future walk. |
| **SC-BL-6** | Basic Information tab heading | `Service Charge` (no office name) | `Service Charge` with `Local Office : <office name>` shown as a separate context line below the heading | **intentional-UX** | The new site displays the local office context explicitly in the page, which is consistent with the office-selector MFE pattern (NM-2211). The heading itself is unchanged. The old site exposed the office name only in the History heading, not in Basic Information. |
| **SC-BL-7** | Percentage edit affordance | Click-to-edit: read-only display until single click activates inline text input | New site: always-visible inline decimal inputs (`inputmode="decimal"`); no click-to-reveal step required | **intentional-UX** | The new site renders inputs directly in the table rather than behind a click-to-reveal affordance. This is an Angular MFE UI difference, not a functional regression — the edit capability is present on both. |

## Coverage Manifest (machine-enumerated)

Machine denominator (Basic Information resting state): **29** element(s). Provenance JSON: `reports/walk-coverage/service-charge-basic-info.json` (enumerated 2026-08-11, enumerate-page.mjs, run-id nm3344-denominator-0811).

Note: the old-site baseline covers both Basic Information and History tab behaviors as observed on nav2 (office 1101). The machine enumeration here covers the new-site resting state (Basic Information tab default). The History tab content was not machine-enumerated (see history inventory gap note). Coverage_Ratio for this baseline artifact reflects the new-site resting-state denominator only.

Walk_State: office=1101 module=service-charge walked=[resting,tab:history] (this is the old-site walk this artifact records — both tabs were reached on nav2, see §3 and §4; the machine manifest below is a separate new-site office-1604 resting enumeration, as the note above explains)
Coverage_Ratio: 29/29 (100%)
